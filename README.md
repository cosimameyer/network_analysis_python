# Network analysis with conflict data 

Civil wars often host various actors — ranging from non-state actors, like rebel groups, to state actors, like the government of a country. Taking Syria’s current civil war or Iraq’s invasion in 2003 as recent and tragic examples, they illustrate the complexity of civil wars perfectly. Various pro- government, government(s), opposition, as well as terrorist groups pursue diverse goals while clashing every now and then against each other. I propose two patterns: either a cluster of violent interaction or dispersed patterns with less overlap in the violent groups. Analyzing and visualizing these violent patterns using the dyadic [UCDP GED data set](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/), both networks for Sub-saharan Africa and Middle East point in the expected direction. Sub-saharan Africa seems to drive the appearance of the overall network (including all conflict parties worldwide).
